## **Setting up your system**

Wax also requires you to install dependencies on your machine, including:

* Homebrew  
* Ruby/rbenv (a recent version); this version should be set up so that it does not conflict or overwrite your system's endemic Ruby version  
* Bundler (as part of your Ruby installation)  
* Image Magick  
* Ghost Script  
* Git  
* Libvips  
* GitHub Desktop

You can download these manually or using a Docker container. Follow Wax's [**Setting up your system**](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/wax/setting-up-your-system/) guide to do this and the [Using Docker](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/wax/setting-up-your-system/with-docker/) guide if you wish to use Docker.
