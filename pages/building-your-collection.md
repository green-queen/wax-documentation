## **Building your collection**

Ideally you’d already have a specific collection you’ve built in mind before you begin to publish it and exhibit it somewhere. Wax is flexible with the types of collections it can exhibit, but it does depend on a collection that is composed of digital objects paired with dedicated metadata values in fields you’ve set.
