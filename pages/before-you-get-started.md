## **Before you get started: knowledge dependencies**

Understanding how to use Wax is dependent first on a basic understanding of the following:

* The terminal and/or command line on your computer (and, by extension, how local directories and file storage work)  
* Git (and, by extension, GitHub)  
* HTML, Markdown, and CSS (on a basic level)  
* Jekyll (particularly how to read YAML files and page front matter)

This seems like a whole laundry list, but in reality, many of the tools, languages, or systems on this list are easy to understand once you get the hang of them.

Since the Git-related commands are run through the command line, I recommend learning the list of technical concepts in the order they appear above. You can use the resources below to get started:

### How do I know if I know enough?
This is relative, but my best estimate would be that if you can do the following, you're probably prepared to start working with Wax:
* Change directories using a command in the command line. Successfully run a command using the command line.
* Create a respository in GitHub. Create a file and add content in GitHub. Create a folder in GitHub.
* Understand basic differences between HTML and Markdown.
* Write some Jekyll front matter for a page.
