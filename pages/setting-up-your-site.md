## **Setting up your site**

Sites built with Wax use Jekyll, a static site generator, and GitHub Pages, a web-hosting method built into GitHub. The Wax devs recommend that if you are familiar with Jekyll, you can set up your site yourself, but if youâ€™re new to Jekyll and/or anything else in this guide, you should use the Wax demo template to get started:

1. Navigate to the [Wax template repository](https://github.com/minicomp/wax) on GitHub.com.
2. Find the green **<> Code** button. Click it and then click "Download Zip". A file `wax-main` will download to your local computer.
3. Rename the `wax-main` zip file to whatever you'd like to name your collection.

You can also use the Wax template through GitHub.com:
1. Login to GitHub.com or sign up for a free account.
2. Navigate to the [Wax template repository](https://github.com/minicomp/wax).
3. Click the green **Use this template** button. This will create a new repository. Minicomp suggests naming this repository for your collection title.
4. Find the green **<> Code** button. Copy the HTTPS URL it shows you, e.g.: `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
5. Open your computer's command line. Using the `cd` command, change into the directory you want your project to go into (e.g. Downloads, Documents, Desktop)
6. Run the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL you copied in step 4: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
7. A new project folder `your-repo-name` will appear in the directory you specified in step 5. The name depends on your repository name on GitHub.com
