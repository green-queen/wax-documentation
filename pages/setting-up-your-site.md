## **Setting up your site**

Sites built with Wax use Jekyll, a static site generator, and GitHub Pages, a web-hosting method built into GitHub. The Wax devs recommend that if you are familiar with Jekyll, you can set up your site yourself, but if youâ€™re new to Jekyll and/or anything else in this guide, you should use the Wax demo template to get started. Follow the [Copy the demo template section](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/wax/setting-up-your-site/copy-the-demo-template/) on the Wax documentation to do the latter.
