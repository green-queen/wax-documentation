### **.github**

This folder, and all of the files it contains, are used when you serve the site using GitHub Actions instead of directly through the main branch of your site. If you’ve already served your site through GitHub Pages and intend to keep it that way, you don’t need this file. If you want to know more, please see the [GitHub Actions section of the Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/).
