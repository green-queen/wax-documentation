### **Generating and adding derivatives, search info, and object pages**

Follow the [Running the tasks section](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/wax/running-the-tasks/) of the Wax documentation. Note that when you get to the search task, your SEARCH\_NAME will be “**main**”. If you have any multi-image items in your collection, I recommend creating IIIF derivatives instead of simple derivatives, since the IIIF viewer handles multi-image items better.
