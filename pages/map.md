The interactive map is a feature of WaxBuilder taken and modified from the CollectionBuilder source code (thank you, Devin Becker). All map features are managed by the following files:
* _includes/map-js.html
* _layouts/map.html
* _data/map-settings.yml
* _data/config-map.csv

## map--js.html
This is the Javascript that runs the map itself. 


I am currently working on consolidating this files in the future.
