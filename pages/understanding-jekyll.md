## **Understanding Jekyll**

Congratulations\! You should now have a Wax site. Before you start customizing, it is important to understand some basic information about how Jekyll works so that you can update your site appropriately.

The most important element to recognize, since it’s required for every page on your site, is front matter. Take the time to explore the [front matter section of the Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) so that you understand what you’re looking at. All of the pages in your repository pages folder, as well as those in the folder with your collection item pages (named \_yourcollectionname), have front matter that determines how they display and what their content is. For an example, see the [page for obj1 in the \_qatar collection folder](https://github.com/minicomp/wax/blob/main/_qatar/obj1.md) on the Wax demo site.
