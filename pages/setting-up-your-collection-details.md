### **Setting up your collection details**

Before you start making your metadata, I recommend that you decide what your collection is going to be named first. You can give your site any fancy title you want later on, but the short collection name is what you will use internally in your files. 

For example, the site title for the Wax demo is “Wax”. However, the name of the collection is “qatar”. In my own Wax collection, my site title is “Medieval Fragment at Cornell”. My collection name is “medieval-fragments”. Your collection name should be short, preferably all lowercase, and should not include any special characters or spaces besides dashes (-).
